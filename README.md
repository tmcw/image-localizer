## image-localizer

A very focused, limited tool that I wrote for myself. It runs over Markdown
files, presumably part of a Jekyll blog, and downloads references to Flickr
and then rewrites the Markdown file to point to those references. Attempts to
avoid unnecessary reformatting as much as possible.
